What Glitch?
======================
The What Glitch? scripts were made to demonstrate the wide variety of glitches and compression artifacts you can find in image file formats. The method used in most of the scripts is to find and replace parts of text within the image file, although reducing the bit depth can also produce commonly seen glitch visuals.

Required Dependencies
=====================
Sed
avconv
GIMP
Imagemagick

Basic Usage
==================
1. Make the file executable: In a terminal type chmod+x what_glitch_1bitgif.sh
2. Run ./what_glitch_1bitgif.sh /path/to/video/file
3. Hit Enter
4. Wait

Notes
==================
The scripts have only been tested on Ubuntu 10.10 and 12.04. If you are able to get them working with other operating systems please feel free to share your techniques

As this scripts processes each frame of a video file it will take a very long time to complete. It is recommended for use only on short video clips!
