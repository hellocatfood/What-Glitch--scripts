What Glitch?
======================
The What Glitch? scripts were made to demonstrate the wide variety of glitches and compression artifacts you can find in image file formats. The method used in most of the scripts is to find and replace parts of text within the image file, although reducing the bit depth can also produce commonly seen glitch visuals.

Required Dependencies
=====================
Sed
FFMPEG
Mplayer
Imagemagick

Basic Usage
==================
1. Make the file executable: In a terminal type chmod+x what_glitch_webp.sh
2. Run ./what_glitch_1bitgif.sh
3. Drop a video file into terminal window and press Enter

Notes
==================
The scripts have only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.10. If you are able to get them working with other operating systems please feel free to share your techniques

These scripts seem to work best with AVI video files that are 24 or 25 frames per second.

Make sure the name of the directory containing the image to glitch doesn't contain spaces e.g. "untitled_folder" instead of "untitled folder"

As this scripts processes each frame of a video file it will take a very long time to complete. It is recommended for use only on small video clips!
