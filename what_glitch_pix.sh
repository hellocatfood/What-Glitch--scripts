#What Glitch?
#======================
#The What Glitch? scripts were made to demonstrate the wide variety of glitches and compression artifacts you can find in image file formats. The method used in most of the scripts is to find and replace parts of text within the image file, although reducing the bit depth can also produce commonly seen glitch visuals

#Required Dependencies
#=====================
#Sed
#FFMPEG
#Mplayer
#Imagemagick
#GIMP

#Basic Useage
#==================
#1. Make the file executable: In a terminal type chmod+x what_glitch_webp.sh
#2. Run ./what_glitch_pix.sh
#3. Drop a video file into terminal window and press Enter

#Notes
#==================
#The scripts have only been tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.10. If you are able to get them working with other operating systems please feel free to share your techniques

#These scripts seem to work best with AVI video files that are 24 or 25 frames per second. Files that are 30 frames per second get out of sync with the audio

#Make sure the name of the directory containing the image to glitch doesn't contain spaces e.g. "untitled_folder" instead of "untitled folder"

#The video needs audio order for this script to work. If you know what you're doing you can edit parts of this script for it to work on files that have no audio

#As this scripts processes each frame of a video file it will take a very long time to complete. It is recommended for use only on small video clips!
